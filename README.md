# Go Todo App

I am building a small todo app as an opportunity to learn Go. This is a work in progress and likely written in unidiomatic Go.

## Issues

The Go language server has trouble with build tags when developing on Linux. You can see the [LSP GitHub issue here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29202).
